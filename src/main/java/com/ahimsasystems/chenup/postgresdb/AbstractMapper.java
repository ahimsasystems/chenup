/* This is an abstract class that provides a template for mapping database records to Java objects.
 * It uses a DataSource to retrieve connections and execute SQL queries.
 * The `retrieve` method fetches a record by its UUID and maps the result set to a newly created Java object.
 * Subclasses must implement the `mapFields` method for the specific type they are mapping.
 * This design follows the Template Method pattern, allowing subclasses to define specific mapping logic while reusing the common retrieval logic.
 * This is also implementing a good deal of the persistenceManager functionality, so it may a good place to start for that. The most important thing to note for that, though, is that mapping code is generated, so there has to be a specific mapper for each class that is persisted.
 * Is there a possible way to register the mappers with the persistence manager? Or should this remain part of the generated code? In any case, at this point the mappers must talk to the persistence manager in order to register these objects to be managed.
